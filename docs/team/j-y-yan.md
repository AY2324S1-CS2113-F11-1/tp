# Jia Yan's Project Portfolio Page

FITNUS is a desktop fitness tracking application that allows NUS students to set and maintain fitness goals for themselves. The user interacts with it using a command line interface(CMI). It is believed that if user can type fast, the efficiency of using this app will be much higher than an usual application that supports graphic interface.

## Contributions

### The ExerciseLog Class
The way that I contributed to the project is by creating and implementing the ExerciseLog class and its associated classes. For example,
there are specific commands that users who want to interact with the exercise log can use, which are the log, delete, update, and view commands.
This gives the user full CRUD functionality of the exercise log.

### Documentation
I contributed to the UG in the parts that are related to the ExerciseLog class and the introduction. In the DG, I contributed to the `Update Exercises from Log feature` section and all the diagrams in that section.

### Team-Based Tasks
* Release various issues about improvement and bug reports of the app
* Enable assertions in gradle
* Correct coding style problems for all classes before v2.1 
* Update UG for calorie goal related functionality
* Add table of content with markdowns for all parts in UG
* Change the title style, add features and future developments in UG to enhance completeness
* Add more detailed method documentations to improve readibility
